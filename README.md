# Support-KPI-and-SLA-Monitoring-Dashboard
This project analyzes Support Operations using KPIs like incident volume, SLA compliance, response speed, backlog aging, and CSAT. Using five linked datasets, I built a Power BI data model, created DAX measures, and designed an interactive dashboard that reveals key trends, risks, and performance insights.
